            ##**UX**

            This sites target demographic are oridinary people and business' in need of a professional opinion and 
            a professional reliable service. This page can help them achieve this by providing efficient usability/interactivity,
            simple content and layout with paragraphs with proven work ethic,
            mobile first display, showcasing of previous work and consumer testimonials.  

            Because Tree Solutions vehicles are on the roads so much, the mobile first display is the important
            aspect because its going to be in public that most people see the company advertised and 
            the quickest thing for anyone to do is google the web address that is seen.
