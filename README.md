## ** Features **

(you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.)

When beginning this project I had so cool things in my head that I wanted to try out but as I started 
coding I decided to keep it simple and basic because I felt i was wasting too much time trying to implement 
features that were just there for show rather than UX. 

The site features a standard layout. On the first page it has a really cool hero image looking up into the canopy 
of a conifer forest, showcasing how mystical our woodlands are.

Underneath is a embedded video of a technical dismantle that is a couple of years old but relevant and this 
is the type of smooth craftsmanship TreeSolutions is achieving.

In the footer of the pages, also kept basic, are all working contact links. Facebook, Phone, Email and Instagram.

On the following pages mostly consisting of Carousels, showcasing more of the specialized and highly technical work carried out
by this company.

I really enjoyed implementing the contact modal and it actually turned out better than I thought. Theres still a little bit of 
coding to do on it.
        
/*Throughout the entie website, I didnt take much code from elsewhere. The Bootstrap Navbar 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/ and the burger icon I replaced as a tree from Font-Awesome, 
I thought that was a cool feature and I hope user realise this is the dropdown menu :).
I chose to keep it as simple as I could without the bussle of 
features that are just there for show making the build more complex than it needs to be.

The opening hero image I found on https://www.pexels.com/.

The background images on all the pages I got on google images and chopped and flipped it to make it look different.

Navbar suppresses 'burger icon' on mobile and tablet and also follows the scroll downwards.

The features will be on the homepage, I want to implement a slideshow gallary of previous work/ equipment. */

## ** Technologies Used **

* I used Bootstrap for most of everything, but I dont think i'll be using it again in future projects, not unless I 
I feel theres something I really need from it. For responsiveness I'd like to concentrate on CSS Grid and/or Flexbox.

* I used GIMP on linux to edit the photos and to cut the logo, flip the backgrounds images and to scale the images for the 
carousels, which I learned its better to use images that are auto the same sizes instead of cropping and scaling down the pixels.

* Pexel.com was used for the Hero image. 

* Figma was used for the wireframes and for the next project i hope Linux 20. is released so I can use wine and balsamiq,
I had issues with the release key and it turns out its actually a bug in the Bionic Beaver Repo. This lost me 2 days.

* Font-awesome was used for the icons on the footer and also the tree icon in the navbar.

* StackOverflow.com was used for troubleshooting alongside intercom on the CodeInstitute website.
